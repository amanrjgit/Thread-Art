A sophisticated web application that transforms ordinary images into stunning thread art representations using computational algorithms and digital simulation.

## Overview

The Thread Art Generator is an interactive application that creates string art simulations from user-uploaded images. It digitally replicates the traditional craft technique of stretching threads between a series of pins to form recognizable images. The application uses a greedy algorithm that strategically places lines between "nails" positioned around a circular frame to approximate the uploaded image.

## Features

- **Interactive Image Upload & Cropping**: Upload any image and crop it to focus on the subject
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust thread strength, maximum thread count, nail spacing, and output size
- **Live Generation Animation**: Watch the thread art being created in real-time
- **High-Quality Output**: Generate detailed thread art in your desired resolution
- **Downloadable Results**: Save your generated thread art as a PNG image
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive design for easy navigation

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
[https://github.com/amanrjgit/Thread-Art.git](https://github.com/amanrjgit/Thread-Art.git)
cd thread-art-generator

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-image
- OpenCV (cv2)
- PIL
- streamlit-cropper
- streamlit-image-select

You can install all required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. Upload an image (JPG, JPEG, or PNG format)

4. Crop the image if necessary to focus on the subject

5. Adjust the parameters:
   - **Thread Strength**: Controls how dark each thread appears
   - **Maximum Threads**: Sets the total number of threads to use
   - **Nail Spacing**: Adjusts the density of nails around the perimeter
   - **Output Size**: Determines the resolution of the final image

6. Click "Generate Thread Art" and watch the algorithm work

7. Download your finished thread art using the download button

## How It Works

The Thread Art Generator employs the following algorithm:

1. **Image Processing**: Converts the uploaded image to grayscale and normalizes it
2. **Nail Placement**: Positions virtual "nails" around a circular perimeter
3. **Thread Selection**: For each iteration:
   - Evaluates all possible connections from the current nail position
   - Selects the thread that best improves the approximation of the original image
   - Adds the selected thread to the canvas
   - Moves to the new nail position
4. **Visualization**: Renders the threads with anti-aliasing for a smooth appearance

The algorithm uses a greedy approach that maximizes image improvement with each new thread.

## Technical Implementation

- **Image Representation**: Images are processed as NumPy arrays
- **Thread Simulation**: Uses line anti-aliasing for realistic thread appearance
- **Optimization**: Implements efficient line drawing algorithms to speed up processing
- **UI**: Built with Streamlit for an interactive, responsive interface

## Performance Considerations

- Processing time depends on image size and thread count
- Higher thread counts produce more detailed results but require more processing time
- The application displays progress updates and statistics during generation
